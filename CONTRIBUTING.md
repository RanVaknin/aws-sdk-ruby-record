# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby-record/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby-record/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

### Setting Up a Development Environment

You can install the development dependencies necessary to run unit tests with `bundle install`. To run integration tests, you will need to set up AWS credentials on your machine. In practice, this means a shared credential file or environment variables with your credentials. These tests may have some AWS costs associated with running them since AWS resources are created and destroyed within these tests. Integration tests are not run unless you set the environment variable `AWS_INTEGRATION`.

### General Contribution Standards

* Documentation improvements are always welcome. If adding a specific code example, consider also if that example would be appropriate to add as a unit or integration test.
* For bug fixes or refactors, please ensure that code coverage remains the same or improves if at all possible. Especially for bug fixes, please include the unit and/or integration tests that reproduce the failure case.
* For new features, at minimum include full unit test coverage, and ideally include integrations tests for the top-line behavior. Documentation is also required.
* If you need help with integration testing or with writing documentation for a feature, let us know. We're happy to review a prototype of a feature ahead of development of full documentation/integration testing.

## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels ((enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any ['help wanted'](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby-record/labels/help%20wanted) issues is a great place to start.
